#Copyright Notes:
* Code primarily reflects the authors of the three.js examples under the MIT License 
"http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_shaders_ocean.html"
and
"http://threejs.org/examples/webgl_loader_obj_mtl.html"

* Please Note:
The most heavily borrowed code(that isn't from three.js examples) is actually from the work of an unnamed jsFiddle.net author(previously unattributed user, possibly identified as "WestLangley") who is assumed to be the same stackoverflow user who answered a question about a downward facing camera here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16227714

#Housecleaning
* Almost none of josdirksen's code remains: consider forking the repository, then rolling that fork back to a previous commit such that it accurately reflects the attribution, then sanitizing the remainder of borrowed code. Credit to josdirksen will then be preserved in the README.md.
* UPDATE: more josdirksen code has been added(sort of) at cantren.github.io/Install Instructions/server setup.txt http://www.smartjava.org/content/capture-canvas-and-webgl-output-video-using-websockets
* UPDATE: in the current master the josdirksen websockets code has been removed as a consequence of a "screen tearing" problem. 





# What is SimBox?

“SimBox” is a cross-platform simulation environment developed by Nicholas Cantrell that runs in any WebGL capable web 
browser(such as Chrome.exe). It was developed in order to allow new students to rapidly gain a high level of proficiency with 
autonomous vehicle software development without the high barriers to entry created by making a mechanically and electrically 
integrated robot submarine a prerequisite to testing software.

# Live Demo:
http://cantren.github.io

#How it works:
The control scheme should be familiar to anyone that has played PC-based First-Person-Shooter genre games, with the slight 
modification that vertical mouse position controls Submarine depth instead of camera “pitch”.


ASDW controls should be intuitive to many new students. The horizontal mouse cursor position on the screen controls “yaw”, 
and the keyboard input are used to control the vehicles translation through the water.


The bottom left hand corner shows a “bottom facing camera” which is used to identify and orient the submarine relative to the 
orange “path markers” which are placed along the competition mission path every year by the organizers of the AUVSI Robosub 
Competition.


The bottom right hand corner shows a “preview window” square white box. This is used to preview the computer vision filter 
perspective while the software is running. For more information, please see “Integration/Interface”.


# Integration/Interface:
The API for “SimBox” is based on Human Interface Device input, as well as an FFMPEG video software program called “ffserver” 
which allows for the client(computer connected to cantren.github.io) to run a local server on their PC for the SimBox 
“Preview Window” to display.


The video that is broadcast from this local server(http://127.0.0.1:8090/simbox.swf) ultimately must be generated on-the-fly 
using screen capture software(FFMPEG + X11Grab)[Linux] OR (FFMPEG + Screen Capture Recorder)[Windows] which is used to record 
a live screencast to ffserver feed #1. 

OpenCV’s “VideoCapture” class uses this “feed #1” as its input stream, does the necessary processing on it, and then outputs 
the post-filtering feed to the ffserver “feed #2”(IE. http://127.0.0.1:8090/simbox.swf).


When in “autopilot mode”, the OpenCV server will take control of the mouse and keyboard. A demonstration of this can be found 
at the following url:

# Install Instructions

1. npm install
2. bower install
3. gulp

https://github.com/cantren/Vunit[Linux Version]

[TODO: make Windows version][Windows Version]

# Feature Request(s)
At this time, a universal interface using a Teensy 3.0 to emulate HID input has not been considered a priority use of limited 
resources, however people interested in developing this functionality are encouraged to do so.

# FFMPEG Setup
[TODO: write FFMPEG installation/quickstart guide for Windows & Linux]
